Heyo,

This place gathers tales about making pancakes *and* computer science. An hopefuly delightful combo!.

For the pancake side, there'll be a strong focus on the crÃªpes variant: flatter but larger pancakes, stuffed with anything close to tasty.

For the computer science side, it's all about about computer architecture, algorithms, image processing and synthesis, system administration, compilation and more!
