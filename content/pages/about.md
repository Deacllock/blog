Heyo,

This place gathers tales about making pancakes *and* computer science. An hopefuly delightful combo!.

For the pancake side, there'll be a strong focus on the crÃªpes variant: flatter but larger pancakes, stuffed with anything close to tasty.

For the computer science side, it's all about about computer architecture, algorithms, image processing and synthesis, system administration, compilation and more!

Here's [my github](https://github.com/multun/) by the way :)

Finding my email shouldn't be too hard if you want to have a talk !

I'm always on IRC as well, multun on freenode.
